          <p class="section-about-p">
            My path of self-growth started when, after hitting rock bottom, I
            came to the realisation that absolutely all good and bad in my life
            ties to the choices I make.
          </p>
          <p class="section-about-p">
            This level of responsibility means that if I can create it all, I
            can change it too - I took my power back!
          </p>
          <p class="section-about-p">
            This led to years of self-development, hundreds of books and all
            sorts of interesting exploration.
          </p>
          <p class="section-about-p">
            I turned my life around and in the process I empowered many women to
            do the same.

          <p class="section-about-p">
            The Empower me Collective is about building a collective of
            like-minded people who wants to grow, learn form each other and
            courageously embark on a path to achieve what we want in life.
